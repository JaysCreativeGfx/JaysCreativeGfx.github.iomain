            <h3>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h3>
            <p class="list">The bouba/kiki effect is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. It was first documented by Wolfgang KÃ¶hler in 1929 using nonsense words. The effect has been observed in American university students, Tamil speakers in India, young children, and infants, and has also been shown to occur with familiar names. It is absent in individuals who are congenitally blind. The effect was investigated using fMRI in 2018.[1] The bouba/kiki effect is one form of sound symbolism.[2]</p>

                <p class="list">This effect was first observed by Georgian psychologist Dimitri Uznadze in a 1924 paper.[3] He conducted an experiment with 10 participants who were given a list with nonsense words, shown 5 drawings for 5 seconds each, then had to pick a name for the drawing from the list of given words. He describes the different "strategies" participants developed to match words to drawings and quotes their reasoning. He also describes situations where participants described very specific forms that they associated with a nonsense word, without reference to the shown drawings. He develops a theory of four factors that influence the way names for objects are decided.</p>
